# WavePainter

WavePainter is a custom wavetable synthesizer which allows the user to draw a waveform and then play it at any pitch using MIDI input.

It is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with the PiTFT Capacitive Touchscreen.

WavePainter uses the JACK Audio Connection Kit for synthesis and [pygame | Java] for the GUI.
